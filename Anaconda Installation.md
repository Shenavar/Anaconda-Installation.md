# How to install Anaconda on Ubuntu
This tutorial for installing Anaconda is written based on
[Anaconda Documentation!](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)
.

1. Go to 
[this page!](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#linux) 
and download **Anaconda installer for Linux**.

The downloaded file will usually be place in your *Download* directory which will be addressed as

~/Downloads/

```sh
~/Downloads/
````
directory.
