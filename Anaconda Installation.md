# I. How to install Anaconda on Ubuntu

This tutorial for installing **Anaconda** is written based on
[Anaconda Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)
. You need to be connected to internet to install **Anaconda**. To install **Anaconda**

0. In case of requesting for download from banned locations, you have to use a DNS, VPN, or Proxy out of the region.
Edit the file `/etc/resolv.conf` and replace the `nameserver 127.0.0.1` (or etc..) lines with `nameserver 178.22.122.100` and `nameserver 185.51.200.2`. This will switch your default DNS servers to <https://shecan.ir> infrastructure and **it will tunnel whole traffic of your machine**.


1. Go to 
[this page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#linux) 
and download [Anaconda installer (python 3.8) for Linux](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh). If download failed, follow any of the methods below:


   - Go to 
   [fumdrive](https://fumdrive.um.ac.ir/index.php/s/eFzf63ZHn8WPLqF) 
   and download Anaconda. This link is provided to you from **AstroGroup** of *Ferdowsi University of Mashhad*.
   
   or
   
   - Install an application for open internet such as *Lantern*. This is explained in detail below (See **II. Updating Anaconda** below this page). After downloading and running *Lantern*, or somethig similar, download anaconda from the 
[this page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#linux).

Once downloaded, the file will be usually placed in your *Download* directory which, in what follows, will be addressed as
```sh
~/Downloads/
````
If the file is placed in another directory, e.g. *Desktop* etc., then you would need to modify the address in the following commands. Or, you may simply cut and paste the file into *Downloads* directory.

2. Now, open a terminal by simply pressing *ctrl + alt + t* simultaneously. You see something like this:

The part 
```sh
hossein@Chortkeh2:~$
````
in green font, and on the top left, is my laptop's name! So, you would see something else instead. Now

   - To install Anaconda for **Python 3.7**, enter the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
        bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ````

like this:

3. Press *enter*., then you would see the following message 

  ```sh
  In order to continue the installation process, please review the license agreement.
  ````
  Click Enter to view license terms. Then, scroll down to the bottom and enter **yes** to accept the terms.
  
  
4. Next, the installer asks you to press **enter** to accept the *default install location*. **We strongly recommend you to choose the default install location**. Specially, **Do not** choose the path as **/usr** for the Anaconda/Miniconda installation because you will be in trouble shortly!

After accepting the default directory, the installer shows the next message: 
```sh
PREFIX=/home/<user>/anaconda<2 or 3>‚Äù
````

The installation process continues for a few minutes; then, it will be completed.

5. Now, you see the next message:
  ```sh
  Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?
  ````
  
write **yes** and press enter.  
  
6. The installer finishes by showing the next message:
  ```sh
  Thank you for installing Anaconda 3
  ````
  
7. The installer provides a link to install **PyCharm** for Anaconda at https://www.anaconda.com/pycharm. However, installing **PyCharm** depends on you. We do not need **PyCharm** for this workshop.

# II. Updating Anaconda

This part is written based on
[Updating from older versions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/update-version/) from 
[Anaconda Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)
.

To update anaconda to the latest version, you can simply run one of the following commands in your *terminal*:

```sh
conda update conda
````

Or 

```
sh conda update --all
````

As mentioned above, in Iran, you will probably encounter some problems in updating or even installing Anaconda. If so, we recommend you to install Lantern. To do so,

1. You need to have **wget** installed. If you don't have it, simply run:

```sh
sudo apt-get install wget
````

in your terminal.


2. Next, download the source of Lantern by running this command in your terminal:

```sh
wget https://lantern.io/lantern-installer-64-bit.deb
````


3. Go to the directory which includes the downloaded file (usually *Home* directory ) and execute the following command in terminal:

```sh
sudo apt install ./lantern-installer-64-bit.deb
````

Enter your *password* and Lantern will be installed. 


4. Once installed, open a terminal and run Lantern

```sh
lantern
````

Now, the open internet is available through your whole device.


5. Using open internet, you can update **Anaconda** by 

```sh
conda update conda
````

Or 

```sh
conda update --all
````

as mentioned above.

6. We strongly encourage you to read 
[Updating from older versions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/update-version/) 
to get familiar with other forms of updating Anaconda. You might need it some day.
